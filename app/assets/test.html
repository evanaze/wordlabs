<h4>This is the first in a two-part series on privacy and Web 3. Next week, I&#8217;ll continue my riff on the origin of
    modern conceptions of privacy. </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Therefore whatever you have said in the dark shall be heard in the light, and what you have whispered in private
        rooms shall be proclaimed on the housetops.</p>
    <p>-Luke 12:3</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Web 3 is the reverse of web 2 in severals ways, and that &#8216;flippening&#8217; can be disorienting</p>
<p>Take the usual ordering of consumer usefulness followed by monetization, as one clear example.</p>
<p>In Web 2, you first find a viral consumer use case and then, often much later, find some way to pay for it.
    Meanwhile, you float the company with speculative capital from VCs. As late as the time of Facebook&#8217;s IPO, the
    ads system was a mess and did not generate the sort of revenue growth that justified the company&#8217;s massive
    valuation. The second half of my memoir <em>Chaos Monkeys</em> documents just that mad (and successful) scramble fix
    the company&#8217;s broken monetization. </p>
<p>In Web 3, companies achieve liquidity early via &#8216;tokenomics&#8217; and other novel mechanisms to raise capital
    from users (often highly speculative in nature), and build the necessary technical infrastructure to create an
    alternative internet: decentralized servers, identity-management &#8216;wallets&#8217;, token exchanges allowing
    easy movement among various ecosystems, etc. The viral consumer use case (if there is one) comes much later, much to
    the derisive trolling by the latest wave of crypto-skeptics.</p>
<p>Some Web 2 companies like Uber still aren&#8217;t profitable, years after their founding and having gone public. We
    used to find this odd&#8212;trolls are nothing new and they railed against the early Web 2 companies too&#8212;but
    now we&#8217;ve simply gotten use to it. Web 3 has yet to prove out its flipped model for utility vs. speculative
    value.</p>
<p>The question of data privacy suffers a similar flip between Web 2 and Web3, reversing many long-held assumptions in
    weird and novel ways.</p>
<p>In Web 2, thanks to the tireless efforts of the growth teams at companies like Facebook (plus our own human addiction
    to virtualized socializing), most everyone save anon-account shitposters is perfectly comfortable with living their
    lives fully publicly and online. What we don&#8217;t like in Web 2 is having what we do&#8212;what we buy on Amazon;
    where we stay on Airbnb; what we browse or buy online&#8212;being made public. Everyone may know our locations and
    the faces of our family, but if anyone figures out that I streamed <em>Parasite</em> last night or bought a pair of
    size 43 Birkenstocks, I want EU aircraft to strafe their homes.</p>

<p>Conversely in Web 3, absolutely everything I do &#8216;online&#8217; (whatever that means now; what do we even do
    anymore that <em>isn&#8217;t</em> online in some form or another?) is public and immutably recorded for all to see.
    Imagine for a moment Web 2 worked that way: every time you bought something at Amazon, the company broadcasted it
    publicly, tweeting it out perhaps. ANTONIO BOUGHT A JUMBO PACK OF SUPPOSITORIES. HAHAHAHA. </p>

<p>You (or I) would be outraged. Yet that&#8217;s what happens every time you buy a NFT from OpenSea or plunk a pile of
    money into decentralized exchange UniSwap. It&#8217;s broadcast in the most indelible way possible, in a way that no
    GDPR privacy law will ever be able to do anything about. Somehow, everyone in Web 3, including and especially the
    privacy crypto-bros, are on-board with that plan. </p>
<p>Their only stipulation is that the unique identifier tied to all that activity (the wallet &#8216;address&#8217;) is
    never tied to anyone&#8217;s persistent real-world identity. Like the revelers in a masked ball of yesteryear, so
    long as the masks aren&#8217;t removed, all is well. </p>
<p>What can possibly explain this utterly different framing for notions of privacy among old and new versions of the
    Internet, particularly with the small (but growing) set of users who participate in both?</p>
<p>One helpful concept comes from the academic world of philosophy: Helene Nissenbaum&#8217;s &#8216;<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_integrity">contextual privacy</a>&#8217; is a formal theory of
    privacy considerably more sophisticated (and adaptable) than the moral absolutism that tends to dominate the privacy
    discourse. An example she draws in her work is imagining your interactions with your physician when dealing with a
    medical issue. Even in a world where the right to live as a stranger among strangers reigns supreme, we
    unquestioningly turn over the most intimate medical details to people we barely know. With full consent from us, our
    physician sends off millimetric images of our skulls and organs to remote radiologists who inform you whether
    you&#8217;ve got terminal cancer or not. We do that because, aside from wanting to know if we&#8217;ve got cancer,
    we feel protected by a strong regime of HIPAA legislation plus a professional code of ethics that stiffly constrains
    everyone involved in the data chain, from nurse to surgeon. </p>

<h4>Our species was never meant to be in instant conversation with billions of other humans. Absent a Luddite jihad that

<p>Now, let&#8217;s imagine you leave your doctor&#8217;s office and fire up Instagram to take your mind off the
    diagnosis he just gave you, which is that you don&#8217;t have brain cancer but you simply suffer from chronic
    migraines and will just have to deal. Scrolling past pictures of friends and celebrities, you see an advertisement
    for a migraine medication, specifically for the vestibular migraines you suffer from. While two seconds ago you were
    willing to send images of your brain across the world for medical advice, you now feel horribly violated knowing
    that everyone from Facebook to a pharma marketing team know about your condition. The context of your
    privacy&#8212;what&#8217;s being revealed to whom and for what reason&#8212;utterly changed and you had no say in
    it. </p>
<p>The challenge before us is to figure out the ground rules of privacy in Web 3, where the &#8216;contextual
    privacy&#8217; that has shaped both user expectations and government regulation in Web 2 no longer hold at all; in
    fact, they&#8217;re utterly fipped.</p>
<h4>Those who can&#8217;t innovate, regulate</h4>
<p>To illustrate just how flipped they are, let&#8217;s review the basic tenets of the European Union&#8217;s General
    Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the regnant standard in data privacy (and somewhat emulated in American standards
    like the California Consumer Privacy Act). </p>
<p>There are two foundational concepts in GDPR: the presence and persistence of &#8216;personal data,&#8217; and who
    keeps data around. </p>
<p>The latter is divided into two classes of data hoarder: &#8220;controllers&#8221; and &#8220;processors.&#8221; These
    categories roughly map to &#8216;first party&#8217; and &#8216;third party&#8217; distinction made between (say)
    <em>The New York Times</em> (which you visit and subscribe to), and the web analytics package they use to measure
    how long someone stays on their website. Ultimately, <em>The Times</em> is the real owner of this relationship, who
    both needs to get an opt-in and face the music if found in violation. Their analytics software is merely a data
    orderly. </p>
<p>Who&#8217;s the data controller of the blockchain? Who even owns things like Bitcoin and Ethereum? The short answer
    is nobody and everybody; everybody in this case is the thousands of nodes that do the &#8216;mining&#8217; and
    verification of the network, making sure transactions are legitimate and collectively keeping all the network state
    around. If your personal data makes it onto some public blockchain, it&#8217;s likely on many machines spread all
    over the world, with no singular entity able or willing to take the &#8216;controller&#8217; liability bullet<a
        class="footnote-anchor" href="https://www.thepullrequest.com/feed#footnote-1" id="footnote-anchor-1">1</a>.
    That&#8217;s the &#8216;nobody&#8217;: there&#8217;s no &#8216;real or legal person&#8217; the EU can nail to the
    wall for not deleting data or whatever else their precious GDPR stipulates. <br /><br />Speaking of deletion, just
    what is this &#8216;personal data&#8217;? </p>
<p>The definition seems almost intentionally vague, with every practitioner coming to their own talmudic interpretation.
    Per the letter of the GDPR, personal data is &#8220;an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location
    data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental,
    economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.&#8221;<a class="footnote-anchor"
        href="https://www.thepullrequest.com/feed#footnote-2" id="footnote-anchor-2">2</a> In other words, it&#8217;s
    things that can be traced unambiguously to the real you, and reveal something juicy about you, whether your address,
    medical condition or your taste for Penelope Cruz movies. Along with this vague-seeming definition, there are all
    sorts of restrictions around user deletion power (the &#8216;right to be forgotten&#8217;), obligatory opt-in
    prompts, and the necessity to minimize the scope (and spread) of personal data. </p>
<p>Goes without saying that putting any personal data on a public blockchain violates both spirit and letter of the
    GDPR. If nothing else, the sheer immutability of blockchain data&#8212;you can&#8217;t delete a block without
    redoing the chain, something semi-impossible in practice&#8212;puts it in obvious violation<a
        class="footnote-anchor" href="https://www.thepullrequest.com/feed#footnote-3" id="footnote-anchor-3">3</a>.
    We&#8217;re going to have to get creative if we&#8217;re going to build privacy-compliant apps on the blockchain,
    particularly <a href="https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/attribution-rules-the-world-and-itll">ones involving any user
        targeting or attribution</a>. </p>
<p>One leap of creative interpretation is that behavioral data like transactions (which lives in a bit of grey zone in
    GDPR) are only personal when linked to an actual real person. In the absence of the real <em>you</em>, Amazon
    keeping what some anonymous individual purchased is not obviously regulated by GDPR. In fact, there&#8217;s a
    loophole for keeping data necessary to run a business, such as revenue data to calculate taxes. </p>
<p>Extending that to the chain, so long as the wallet is unassociated with real personal data, either on chain or off,
    it shouldn&#8217;t be subject to the many data restrictions of GDPR by a strict reading of it. Even if you
    don&#8217;t buy the argument, there&#8217;s essentially no way to comply with GDPR with on-chain data, other than
    not putting egregiously personal data (like user information) on chain to begin with. </p>

<p>Well, what happens when you <em>do</em> associate a real person to a wallet, and all the behavioral data that
    implies? That happens routinely when a DeFi company like Coinbase does regulatory Know Your Customer and actually
    verifies your identity, or when a game developer (say) associates your wallet to personal login information like an
    email. This will sound odd, but that linking of an entire blockchain rap sheet to a person suddenly makes that
    wallet be personal data. The holder of the join to the real person can indeed profile the user based on blockchain
    data (even if nobody else in the universe other than the user knows <em>this</em> wallet corresponds to
    <em>that</em> user). The controller in this case, i.e., the entity that can join a wallet&#8217;s data to a user, is
    absolutely responsible for that join only they own; their GDPR responsibility lies in deleting the join that makes
    the profiling/personalization of on-chain data possible, even if deleting on-chain data is itself impossible. </p>

<p>Why such jesuitical acrobatics? </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go back to Nissenbaum&#8217;s contextual privacy. The only way to reconcile the Web 2 privacy context of
    GDPR (which considers identity public but data private) with the Web 3 context of blockchains (where identity is
    private, but data public) is to merge the contexts when the data does the same. In other words, merging identity and
    data makes both subject to GDPR compliance, even if the data was anonymously public before you joined them. Once you
    delete that join to real identity, the data goes back to simply being anonymous and private. This is odd to Web 2
    ears, but again, it&#8217;s the contextual expectation in Web 3. The entity on the compliance hook is whoever owns
    the join, a join that only happens because of a first-party relationship (and opt-in) with the actual user. This is
    about the only way to square this Web 2/3 context circle. </p>
<p>Of course, it means that any such personalization of blockchain data must live with a single entity (or at most a
    processor-type subordinate): you can never decentralize real identity on the blockchain. But that&#8217;s fine. This
    is one area where you absolutely do not want &#8216;trustlessness&#8217; to define how data moves around. </p>
<p>If this all sounds like medieval schoolmen debating the physical dimensions of angels, it&#8217;s not an inapt
    comparison, but a lot of privacy thinking is contrived and convoluted.</p>
<h4>Privacy, the invention</h4>
<p>The word itself &#8216;privacy&#8217; doesn&#8217;t appear even once in the American Constitution, and as a legal
    principle, it wasn&#8217;t until 1890 that <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Right_to_Privacy_(article)">Louis Brandeis formulated it</a> in a way we
    would recognize today. The spark for Brandeis&#8217; historic treatise was the sudden emergence of the telegraph and
    portable cameras; more specifically, his socialite law partner Samuel Warren was getting written up in the gossip
    rags, complete with paparazzi photos. </p>
<p>Once again with Web 3, some newfangled contraption is forcing us to rethink what it means to live among a world of
    strangers, safeguarding our inner worlds lest they be &#8216;proclaimed on the housetops.&#8217; Our species was
    never meant to be in instant conversation with billions of other humans. Absent a Luddite jihad that destroys the
    digital nervous system locking us into global waves of emotion around the next &#8216;current thing,&#8217;
    we&#8217;re going to invent new norms to make the inhuman slightly more livable. It&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve always
    done.</p>

        <p>Some would make the argument that encrypted data on chain is no longer &#8216;personal&#8217; from the GDPR
            perspective. That&#8217;s the argument of blockchains like Monero or ZCash which reveal almost nothing about
            the nature of transactions on their chains, not even wallet addresses. Even if it&#8217;s not on those
            chains, your personal data can be put on-chain but encrypted, and then the private key destroyed as a means
            to &#8216;delete&#8217; it (i.e. make it functionally unreadable). Or you can link to off-chain personal
            data, and simply take down that instead. It&#8217;s not clear yet what the EU thinks about these workarounds
            and whether that&#8217;s &#8216;deleted&#8217;. Apparently, <a
